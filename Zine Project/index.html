<div class="title"> The Music Industry Remains a Boy's Club: How Do Women Break In? </div>

<div class="byline"> BONNIE MARCUS  </div> 


<p><span class="homedropcap">E</span>very year Billboard publishes the Power 100 people in the music industry. The list represents leaders of live, tech, management and recorded music. In 2018, 17% of the list was female, up from 10% in 2017. Men still hold most of the top jobs.</p>


<p>A recent article in Billboard suggests that there are several reasons why there isn’t a larger representation of women in the industry. It remains a boy’s club where women are offered less opportunity, have to work harder to get ahead, have few role models, and face gender bias.</p>

<p>To get a better understanding of the challenges for women in the music industry, I reached out to Third Side Music, based in Los Angeles and Montreal. Third Side Music's Licensing and Creative Services departments are both run by women: Brontë Jane (Director of A&R/Creative Services), Melissa Woods (Head of Creative Services/A&R) and Natalie Cervelli (Head of Creative Licensing Advertising and Trailers), and Lysandra Woods, Head of Film/TV.</p>

<p><div class="headline">Bonnie Marcus:  According to Billboard, there are many reasons for a lack of women in the music industry. What do you think are the top reasons and what can be done about it?</div></p>

<p><b>Melissa Woods:</b> I believe that there needs to be more opportunities given to women at an early age so they are encouraged to explore fields such as music composition and engineering, and know this is not a "male only occupation." I attended an all-girls school and have coincidentally worked with and for many strong females in music, and am confident that the more women there are to mentor and support one another, the better off the industry will be.

 We are seeing more and more progress, anywhere from organizations such as GIRLSCHOOL (which showcases up-and-coming female artists, producers and composers) to the Universal Inclusive Composer Initiative. We all need to keep fighting the good fight.</p>

 <p><div class="headline">Marcus: Was it the intention from the onset to create Third Side Music as an all-female company?</div></p>

 <p><b>Brontë Jane:</b> Our staff is comprised of sixteen hard-working music nerds, industry veterans, and musicians, twelve of whom happen to be women-identifying. In principal, we have always hired (and will continue to hire) those most qualified for the job, but that being said, it's pretty incredible to get to work with some of the most talented women in the industry on a day-to-day basis. Aside from our roster, it's one of the things that attracted me most to Third Side in the first place.</p>


 <p><div class="headline">Marcus:  What’s your best advice on how to break into music professionally (i.e. as an industry member)?</div></p>

<p><b>Lysandra Woods:</b> Music can feel counter-intuitive initially; in some respects it’s a casual industry but your work and communication skills have to be impeccable and professional. Start by doing some research and look for internships and entry-level positions at companies that work with the artists you love. You’ll be putting a lot of yourself into any job in music and working with artists you love can be its own reward. Once you convince someone to hire you then you have to work, work, work... and then work some more. The learning curve is steep but stay calm and positive. Make your colleagues' jobs easier in any way you can, as that's what will make you stand out as a new hire. The bottom line is that you have to kill it at any tasks you are given, no matter how small. We have some really amazing people at Third Side and a few of them began as interns. I can't stress enough how impressive they were as interns, as they all got a lot done without taking up anyone else’s time. That made us want to keep them forever and ever.</p>

<p><div class="headline">Marcus:  What skills/experience are most important?</div></p>

<p><b>Natalie Cervelli:</b> Relationships are of key importance. This is a very social industry, so you have to be able to go out almost every night, building those relationships with clients, artists, managers, etc., and then still show up at work the next day ready to deliver. It’s a tricky balance and not everyone is capable. You really have to build up trust with your clients in order to become one of the few people they reach out to, especially when you work at an indie like Third Side Music.</p>

<p>Politics can also play a huge role, especially in the corporate side of things. I struggled with how to play that game and was often told to "pick my battles" — a saying I absolutely hate. It can be soul crushing. I spent almost 10 years working at the majors, which is long enough to realize that I’d rather work somewhere that cares more about the music than the politics of a corporate command chain. At Third Side, we don’t have time for that. We’re too busy doing our job and helping our artists.</p>

<p><div class="headline">Marcus:  What soft skills are most important? (Self-promotion, communication, politically savvy, networking).</div></p>

<p><b>Cervelli:</b> I’m not sure there’s such a thing as a "soft skill." This industry isn’t something that can easily be defined by a college degree, so every experience you bring to the table is of worth.</p>
