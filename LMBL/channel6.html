	The Johnson family's eldest daughter is taking her first steps into the real world as she heads off to college. "Grown-ish" explores the first trappings of adulthood, and Zoey must navigate through the trials and tribulations of these momentous steps. Zoey discovers that once she leaves the nest, things do not always go her way. The series features "that in between place where you're not quite an adult but facing grown world problems for the first time," Kenya Barris, the show's creator and executive producer, said.
